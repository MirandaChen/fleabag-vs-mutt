# most basic

create a class/object
instance: cat, dog

attribution:
- position (x,y): default, fixed
- shoot angle: default = 45
- how much blood value left

things to consider:
- wind speed
- initial speed

algorithm:
平抛运动
know vx, vy
know time by vy,
know falling point then

logistics:
- first determine wind speed
# second step
animation
speical 道具： double attack, huge attack, stink bomb
set different difficult levels 
# future
add AI player
change angle
change position
add other values such as 体力,$$, wall height
other idea to improve:
- machine learning! let fleabag hit mutt without seeing him
